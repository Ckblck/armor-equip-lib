# Armoury

Armoury is a lightweight library that allows developers to easily implement armour related events. It is compatible with
versions **1.9** through **1.18.1**.

Since it does not rely on inventory interactions to determine armour modifications, Armoury also considers scenarios
where changes are made using methods such as `PlayerInventory#setArmorContents(ItemStack[])`, or when the equipment
suffers from external damage.

> [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) is a required dependency.
